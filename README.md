# quoteGenerator
Displays a random quote when user hits new quote.  They can then get another quote or change the category

I created this using as a way to practice API calls using the Quotes API from API Ninjas here https://api-ninjas.com/api/quotes.
I wanted the quote to be displayed in card in the middle of the screen that flips when a quote is generated displaying the quote and flips back once the user wants to change the category.
